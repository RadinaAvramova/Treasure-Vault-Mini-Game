# Treasure-Vault-Mini-Game

## Overview
Welcome to the Vault Mini Game, an engaging and challenging puzzle game where players need to unlock a vault by turning the handle in the correct direction and the right number of times. The game is built using PIXI.js, a powerful and feature-rich 2D rendering engine, and GSAP, a robust animation library, ensuring a smooth and visually appealing experience.

## Features
Randomly generated secret combinations: Each new game offers a fresh challenge with a unique combination to unlock the vault.
Intuitive user interactions: Players can easily rotate the vault handle by clicking or tapping on either side of the handle.
Engaging animations: The game features smooth handle rotations, blinking lights when the vault is unlocked, and a spinning handle animation when the game resets.
Responsive design: The game automatically adjusts its size and layout according to the browser window size, ensuring an optimal user experience across various devices.
## Gameplay
The objective of the game is to unlock the vault by rotating the handle according to a secret combination. The combination consists of three steps, each requiring the player to turn the handle a specific number of times (1-9) in a certain direction (clockwise or counterclockwise).

Players can rotate the handle by clicking or tapping on either side of it. The game provides immediate feedback on whether the current move is correct or not. If the player makes a wrong move, the game resets, and the handle spins wildly before generating a new combination.

The game is won when the player successfully performs all three steps of the secret combination. Upon winning, the vault door opens, and the lights start blinking to celebrate the victory. The game will restart after 5 seconds.
